- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @AllanKPeak
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in reviving my coding skills which have become VERY rusty over the last 20 years
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python
  

- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I remeber being annoyed when the Data General Nova 4 was introduced with RAM memory and I had to re-write code that depended on state being retained through power cycles.
